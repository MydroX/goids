# Goids (WIP)

## Context

I read an blog post<sup>[1]</sup> of Mehdi Zed about his thought about how he was choosing his ideas for side projects. TL;DR find something you want to do and the techno choice need to go after. Few days after I reviewed a video<sup>[2]</sup> of a scientist named Mehdi Moussaid, specialized in human crowd behaviors, I had an epiphany and wanted to reproduce the boids with the wish to improve my skill on Go. So here is my Goids project!
